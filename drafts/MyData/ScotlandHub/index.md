I recently worked towards the official establishment of the MyData Scotland Hub. We recently pased our peer acceptance interview. Which was an informal chat really.

One of the questions to come up is what is my data to you any why are you interested in it. My answer would be that I want to empower people with their data. Show them ways that they can exert more control over their data. But not as a means of restricting data flow but enabling a more considered and directed flows of data. I think of it as giving citizens another way of expressing their support. Just like we have economic power to decide what we spend our money on, I would like to build towards a future where people have data power. They get to decide where they contribute their data and influence how that data is used.

The reason I am interested in setting up the MyData Scotland hub is to spread that vision here in Scotland. 

All of us involved in setting up the hub are excited an optimistic about the prospects of the hub. Their is clear interest in Scotland to establish themselves as a leading country in data innovation. Edinburgh is aiming to become the data capital of Europe, an ambitious goal. This interest in data combined with the relatively small size of Scotland and the sense of community that there is here leavesus optimistic about the future.

## Hub Objectives

As part of forming a hub we had to outline some concrete objectives that we want to achieve over the next year. How do we see our hub developing? Where would we like to be next year?

As a Hub for Scotland one of our major objectives is speading the MyData ideas throughout Scotland. Acting as an umbrella hub and supporting local discussions on data throughout Scotland. We were originally MyData Edinburgh, but there was consensus that by branding the hub as MyData Scotland we could have a wider influence on Scotland and draw in more interested parties.

We all feel that there is huge interest in the MyData ideas here in Scotland, we just need to tap into that. Announce ourselves properly and hopefully build up a committed group of individuals. A core team.

Currently there aren't that many of us, and we all only have a limited bandwidth which we can commit to MyData. Another objective of ours is become sustainable. Grow a core group of active MyData members in Scotland to at least 20 members. Host regular monthly meetings or calls to discuss how to progress as a hub, how we can meet our objectives.

The March event should be a big one for us. It will, I hope, coincide with us hosting the MyData Global General Meeting. We hope to use this event to build up momentum.

Another interest of ours is in data education, this is driven by Thomas Pressie and is clearly important. We want to target young 7-9 year olds and try to get them to understand that data is created ...

A PoC. This is mainly led by Ian. We hope to show people through a targeted PoC what you can do with data.Currently people might be annoyed or frustrated but there aren't much options. There isn't much opportunity to exert control over data currently so people just give up or accept the status quo. Hopefully though a couple of successful PoC's we could show people the that things could be different.
