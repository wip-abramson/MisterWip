It is easy to get depressed when thinking about Climate Change and the challenges we are going to face over the next century. There can be no doubt now that the dramatic changes we are going to see are going to cause suffering on an epic scale.

This will be species defining century. 

This, I believe, while undoubtedly daunting, presents an unprecedented opportunity to make positive changes in our world. It is an opportunity for our planet to come together around a common goal. An opportunity to shake up the current order of things and forge a new, better world for us all.

“The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.”
― John F. Kennedy 

Of course, it could also go the other way. Towards an altogether more scary vision in which our societies sink into an oppressive, dystopian world full of fear. I believe both outcomes are possible and it is up to every single one of us to prevent the worst from happening.

We need to transition our whole economy. Away from oil. Away from mindless profit. Towards sustainability. Towards clean energy. Towards climate resilience.

This transition needs to be total. Once you start thinking about what this means for the future, you realise that the rules are changing. The old world is dead. Jobs are going to become obsolete. But as our priorities shift a new world will emerge. The world that we will have to create to survive this century. 

Those that understand this and start playing by the new rules. Start building for the new world. Start leading the way forward. Will Prosper.

We need to learn how to live within the limits of our planet. We need to learn how to share. We need to realise that we are all in this together.

Build connections, forge friendships and grow your network. Start small. Start locally. Build upwards.

Those businesses that are sustainable. The towns that can generate their own energy, grow their own food and most importantly the individuals that form strong communities will be most likely to survive.

You have an opportunity to identify where you fit in the new world. The world that will have to emerge and start building towards that. You have a headstart.

How can you take advantage?

If you wait until someone tells you what to do. How to fix this. It will be too late.

Don't give up. Climate change presents a grave danger to our entire species. But realise climate change is presenting us with an opportunity to right the mistakes of the past. The transition towards a fairer, cleaner more sustainable world.

Humans are  an incredible, adaptive and intelligent species. Once we master our environment and learn how to live in harmony with our planet we will be able to look to the stars and truly start shaping our world.

I know I am naive and optimistic. However, I have to believe that we have a chance. Believing in the opportunity gives me that hope that we can not only survive, but thrive in the new world.

Let's stop building on top of past mistakes and start building the new world.
