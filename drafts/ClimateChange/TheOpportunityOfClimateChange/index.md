It is easy to get depressed when thinking about Climate Change and the challenges we are going to face over the next century. There can be no doubt now that the dramatic changes are going to cause suffering on an epic scale.

This is our centuries world war. A species defining century. 

I try not to get caught up on in the doom and gloom of which there is plenty. But look to the opportunity of climate change.

The old world is dead. The rules are changing. If you accept this and start trying to understand the new world. The world that we will have to create to survive this century. You realise that the new world presents opportunity at an unprecendented scale.

We need to transition our whole economy. Away from oil. Away from mindless profit. Towards sustainability. Towards clean energy. Towards climate resilience.

We need to learn how to live within the limits of our planet. We need to learn how to share. We need to realise that we are all in this together. 

If the current climate disasters do not highlight it clearly enough. We are at war.

Those that understand this and start playing by the new rules. Start building for the new world. Start leading the way forward. Will prosper.

Those businesses that are sustainable. The towns that can generate their own energy. Grow their own food.

How can you take advantage?

First, accept how bad it is going to get. Then get involved in doing something about it. Not many people are. But you have to realise out of these communities of people thinking along similar lines will come opportunity. The war against the climate that is coming will need leaders. It will generate jobs. More importanty it could make what you are currently doing obselete.

You have an opportunity to identitfy where you fit in the new world. The world that will have to emerge and start building towards that. You have a headstart.

Build connections, forge freindships and grow your network. Start small. Start local. Build upwards.

If you wait until someone tells you what to do. How to fix this. It will be too late.

The simple things are obvious. Start doing them.

Don't give up. Climate change presents a grave danger to our entire species. But realise climate change is presenting us with an opportunity to right the mistakes of the past. The transition towards a fairer, cleaner more sustainable world.

Humans are  an incredible, adaptive and intelligent species. Once we conquer our environment and learn how to live without polluting the sky really is the limit. 

Lets stop building on top of past mistakes and start building the new world. 

“The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.”
― John F. Kennedy
