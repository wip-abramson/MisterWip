A project to explore the minimum viable toolset we need to enable individuals to issue and verify credentials that they issue.

This simplifies the verification process and allows a bottom up identity layer to form. Me as an individual can issue a credential for access to a part of my website. I know and can easily set up a resolver to retrieve my issuing key so I can verify with pretty much certainty that a holder of this credential is someone that I trust. We need to allow individuals to start credentialing their connections giving them a core of personal trust that they can then use to layer on all the necessary permissions we need in life. Access to accounts, legal status, family status, friendships and in the future control or ownership of items. All could be shared and controlled by this base layer of self issued credentials. The only problem is how to get others to trust these credentials. That is harder.

But the beauty of this is we can still get a lot of value by only the issuer verifying the credentials.

Then this can evolve into communities or groups issuing credentials to their members. They then should be able to add access control to all of their tooling. No more passwords required. Easily set up and distribute access to new resources.
