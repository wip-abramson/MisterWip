Authentication not Identification. Tension between authentication group and DID/VC group. 

Lack of talk on privacy

lack of discussion on higher level. How do we use DID/VC's to actually build an identity system. Identity assurance.

Battle over W3C DID working group.

Work to be done over combining current standards. Getting best of both worlds using DID's with WebAuthn. FIDO. EAT. Etc


A lot of issues still to be resolve. A lot of talking past people. Two different worlds of idm, need more understanding an collab across them.

Dot voting, breakout discussion.

Talk from BC on id for gov and their ability to bootstap SSI networks.

China Social Score. eid.cn. Cyber Trusted ID.

Whitepaper on data minimisation and selective disclosure

Protocol/System design time
Terminology defined and consistently used
Deployment time. Is tech secure. Carefully designed architeture/
With standards aim small and iterate fast. Core functionality. Make extensible as possible.

Difference between directories and registries. Need for registries of DID issuers but not directories? Why?
Microsoft and Google influence over standards.

Modular design. Settle on small peices that people agree on. Don't have scope creep.

DID's not interoperable was the comment often raised
