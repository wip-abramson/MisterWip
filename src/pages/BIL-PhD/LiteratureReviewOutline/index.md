This is my attempt to bring some order to my literature review. I will outline the scope of the review and the areas I plan to focus on, as well as thinking about the order with which to present them.

The goal of my literature review will be to provide all readers with a basic grasp of the underlying research supporting my ideas. I wish for it to be understandable by a determined reader without any prior cryptographic knowledge, but also to cover enough depth to outline where and why my contribution is valuable.

The basics will be covered first, building up into the more complex topics. The two overarching concepts that I will aim to explain are Identity Management - past, future and present. The arguments I wish to present are that centralised stores of personal data however well intentioned the purpose for collection was can be misused and lead serious consequences. Empowering the individual to control their identifiers will benifit everyone. It is possible to have trust in a system without 

Each iteration of identity management systems should be compared against common criteria. What this criteria is I need to define. Could this be a paper? What experiments would I need to set up?

Second I aim to explain the cryptographic building blocks that will be necessary for understanding the thesis. This will start simple convering Symetric Encryption, Public Key Cryptography, Signature Schemes, MACs and zero knowledge.

It will be a brief summary of the ideas.

I then wish to go in depth into Anonymous Credentials, CL-Signatures and Attribute-Based Encryption.


If I were to define five areas of research which my literature review has focussed around so far it would be; Identity, Signature Schemes, Anonymous Credential Systems, Encryption, Privacy. Unfortunately these topics spead out across such a spectrum of work that covering it all will be impossible.

Some of these are linked. For example I will be exploring privacy in terms of identity management. Out of scope is the question of how much privacy an individual should be allowed to have.

My main focus is on Identity. Technical architetures for realising systems that put the individual at the center of thier identity network. Of which I believe the Self-Sovereign model based on the cryptography of Anonymous Credentials to be the most viable. With the new standards Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers.

However this is a new paradigm. I will analyse the older models of identity and suggest why they are not viable for putting the user at the centre and in control of thier identity. Evolving from Centralised identity -> Federated Identity -> User Centric Identity -> Self-Sovereign Identity.

I will go through each of the identity standards in turn. SAML, OpenID, OpenID connect, OAuth, WebAuthn, FIDO and then the DID and VC standards. 

The move towards Strong Authentication through authenticators such as YubiKey. 2FA and Multi FA.

I have discussed national identity management systems. Where do these fit in?
